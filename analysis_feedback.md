**Summary:** The code exhibits some redundancy, particularly in the creation of temporary YAML config files. Both `temp_config_file` and `temp_default_config` functions contain similar structures for defining sample configurations. The only differences are the values assigned to certain keys. This could be improved by creating a helper function that generates the configuration dictionary based on parameters, thus reducing repetition. Additionally, the `feedback_format` section is repeated in both fixtures, which could also be centralized. Overall, while there is some effort to avoid repetition, there are still opportunities for better logic reuse.

### SOLID Analysis
**Score: 7/10**  
**Summary:** The code adheres reasonably well to the SOLID principles, particularly the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP). Each test function has a clear purpose, focusing on a specific aspect of the configuration management system. The `ConfigManager` class appears to encapsulate its responsibilities well. However, the Open/Closed Principle (OCP) could be improved; the `_get_default_config` method is directly patched in tests, which may lead to fragile tests if the implementation changes. A more robust approach could involve using interfaces or abstract classes to allow for easier extension without modifying existing code. Overall, while the code is structured well, there are areas for enhancement, particularly in ensuring that it is open for extension while remaining closed for modification.
