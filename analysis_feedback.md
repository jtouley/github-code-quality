## Analysis for src/ai_client.py
**DRY Score: 6/10**  
The code has some repetition in error handling and prompt creation, but it avoids excessive duplication.

**SOLID Score: 7/10**  
The class adheres to Single Responsibility and Dependency Inversion principles, but could improve on Open/Closed by allowing for easier extension without modification.

## Analysis for src/analyzer.py
**DRY Score: 6**  
The code has some repetition, such as error messages and environment variable checks, which could be refactored into functions to enhance reusability.

**SOLID Score: 5**  
The function does not adhere well to the Single Responsibility Principle, as it handles both environment checks and analysis logic. Separation of concerns could improve maintainability.

## Analysis for src/github_client.py
**DRY Score: 6/10**  
The code has some repetition, particularly in the way headers are set for API requests. This could be abstracted into a separate method to adhere more closely to DRY principles.

**SOLID Score: 7/10**  
The class mostly adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle, but could improve in terms of Dependency Inversion by allowing dependency injection for the environment and requests, enhancing testability and flexibility.

## Analysis for src/post_comment.py
**DRY Score: 7/10** – The code has some repetition, particularly in error handling, which could be abstracted into a utility function.

**SOLID Score: 6/10** – While functional, the code lacks modularity and could benefit from better separation of concerns and dependency injection for improved maintainability.

## Analysis for src/utils.py
**DRY Score: 3/10**  
The function `log` is simple but lacks reusability and abstraction for different logging levels or outputs, leading to potential duplication in future enhancements.

**SOLID Score: 4/10**  
The single responsibility principle is partially met, but the function does not adhere to the open/closed principle, as it requires modification for enhanced functionality.

## Analysis for tests/debug/analyzer_debug.py
**DRY Score: 6/10**  
The code has some repetition, particularly in error handling and the way results are processed. Extracting common functionalities into separate functions could improve adherence to the DRY principle.

**SOLID Score: 7/10**  
The code follows some SOLID principles, such as Single Responsibility (analyzing a repo) and Dependency Inversion (using clients). However, it could benefit from better abstraction and separation of concerns, particularly in handling environment variables and results processing.

## Analysis for tests/debug/github_client_debug.py
**DRY Score: 8**  
The code is mostly DRY, but the repeated print statements could be encapsulated in a function to avoid redundancy.

**SOLID Score: 7**  
The code adheres to some SOLID principles, but it lacks single responsibility and open/closed principles, as the printing logic is mixed with file retrieval.

## Analysis for tests/debug/post_comment_debug.py
**DRY Score: 4/10**  
The code has hardcoded values (e.g., PR number) and lacks reusable functions for error handling and environment variable loading.

**SOLID Score: 5/10**  
The function does a single task but violates the Single Responsibility Principle by mixing environment setup and API interaction. It could be improved with better separation of concerns.

## Analysis for tests/test_ai_client.py
**DRY Score: 9**  
The code avoids repetition effectively, but the fixture could be reused across multiple tests for better DRY adherence.

**SOLID Score: 8**  
The code adheres well to SOLID principles, particularly Single Responsibility, but could improve on Dependency Inversion by allowing more flexible API key management.

## Analysis for tests/test_github_client.py
**DRY Score: 8**  
The code avoids repetition, but the use of a hardcoded token could be abstracted for reuse.

**SOLID Score: 7**  
The test adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle, but could improve by separating environment setup from the test logic for better maintainability.
