If classes or functions are handling multiple responsibilities, it complicates testing and maintenance. Each class should ideally have one reason to change, which is not clearly observed. Moreover, if the code is not designed to accommodate new features without modification (violating OCP), it may require significant changes to add new functionality. The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) may also be lacking if high-level modules are directly dependent on low-level modules, which can lead to tight coupling. To improve adherence to these principles, consider refactoring the code to separate concerns, utilize interfaces or abstract classes, and ensure that new features can be added with minimal changes to existing code."

The `load_config()` function is called multiple times in both `generate_prompt` and `analyze_code` methods. This results in redundant calls to load the same configuration data, which could be avoided by storing the configuration in an instance variable during initialization. Additionally, the construction of the prompt string in `generate_prompt` could be refactored into a separate method to reduce repetition and improve readability.

The `AIClient` class has multiple responsibilities: it handles API key management, configuration loading, prompt generation, and code analysis. This violates SRP, as it would be better to separate these concerns into different classes or methods. \n\nRegarding the Open/Closed Principle (OCP), the class is not easily extendable without modifying existing code, as any changes to the prompt generation or analysis logic would require altering the `AIClient` class itself.

However, there is redundancy in the way the analysis results are handled. The code for writing the analysis output to a file could be extracted into a separate function to avoid repeating the logic of formatting and writing results. Additionally, the repeated checks for `None` when assigning `dry_score` and `solid_score` could be streamlined.

For instance, if there are multiple configurations required for different analyses, the structure could be reused instead of defining it all inline. Additionally, the error handling in the `load_config` function could be refactored into a separate function to avoid repeating the same logic for handling different exceptions. Overall, while there is some reuse of the configuration structure, the potential for further abstraction and reuse exists.\n\n### SOLID Analysis\n**Score: 4/10**  \n**Summary:** The code demonstrates some adherence to the SOLID principles, but it falls short in several key areas. \n\n- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** The `load_config` function is responsible for both loading and validating the configuration.

This repetition could be avoided by creating a private method that returns the headers, which would promote reuse and reduce duplication. Additionally, the error handling for API responses is somewhat repetitive, as both methods check the response status code and handle errors similarly.

To adhere more closely to DRY principles, the logging function could be refactored to allow for different logging levels (e.g., info, warning, error) and potentially log to different outputs (e.g., files, external logging services).
